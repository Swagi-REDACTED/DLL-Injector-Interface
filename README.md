# DLL-Injector-Interface
I set out to make a sleek polished UI for my DLL injector and in my opinion succeeded. 
I'll eventually release my DLL injector however not the source code itself, this does contain the full source code to my injectors UI, I'll do my best to align it with any future updates I make to my injectors UI.
For windows 11(Sorry linux I'm too lazy to make shit compatible yall can fork it) built with visual studio 22, and C++ Standard 23.
